         Hello, I am a highschool graudate moving on to be a freashman in college in Aug. I'm orginally from Queens, NY. 
         Living in Flordia is not the not the best exprience I've been through except for FLVS that helped me out a lot in highschool but at the end of the day I have no other choice.
         I love to enjoy the outdoors go on adventures, munch on trail mixes, ride bikes, go on a hike, and many more fun things. 
         The reason I've signed up for this program is because I would be doing computer-prommgraming as my major so I just wanted experince and learn what coding is really about.
         I've also graudated & recieved and certificate in advanced manufacturing so not only I know how to code I also have the knowledge to operate CNC machinery, operate welding machinery, weld, saute electrical boards and cables. lot enjoying the outdoors going on adventures. 
         I love to travel to differnet countries and states and explore their enviroment. 
         <br>
         * Obsess with custom detailed cars
           Mostly a night life person
           Love to sit back to listen and watch nature 
           Enjoy and being outside in the rain
           My favorite seasons is Fall, Winter, and early Spring.
         <br>  
         But overall the last thing I want to say yes coding can me hard in the beginning but each day I've took into the class it is easier to understand. 
         There was a lot of teamwork involved. I felt more comfortable with my classmate and the instructors (Roger and Frank)when we would help each other out on a assignment outside of class.
         This would be the best program for future prommgramer to get started in the the virtual world. 
       </p>
     <br>
    <p> The reason why I'm instrusted in program is because I've played a lot a videos games like C.O.D...</p>
