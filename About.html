         Hello, My name is Fatima and I am a currently a college student moving up to my Junior year. I started my college year in Aug 2022 after graudating with honors in High School. After, moving from up North I build my insrest towards computers, coding, and manufacturing. During my high school years I recived two certicates one is for front-end web design and the other is for advanced manufacturing. I do have the knowlegde and skills to also do back-end web design which I would prefrer to use Javascrpt and C programs added along with it. What really inspired me to have this imnstesrtes is mainly because of how are technogly and other projects are created. As a teen I used to analyse vthe video games I played from its grapics and it's dialect.</p>
           
         <p> Knowing that there are many programs behind one video game movatied me to start advancing me skills in coding and learn other languges within coding. As for manfacturing I love to assemble project together such as EBA or welding things together. I took a Mechotronics class and we laid out a blue print of how to fix differnt macherny within a warehouse, which I found pretty insresting. From the certicates I recviced in Advanced Manfacuting I knowledge and skills to operate CNC machinery, operate welding machinery, weld, saute electrical boards and cables. lot enjoying the outdoors going on adventures. However, I woouls like to continue to accerlate those skills.</p>
           <br>
        <p> 
         A little bit more about myslef is that I love to travel to differnet countries and states and explore their enviroment. On my down time
         I love to enjoy the outdoors go on adventures, and many more fun things. Sometimes, I would watch videos on different projects  also teach my self another languge for I can be able to communcate more with others.Overall, I usaully try new thiing most of the day. It's a part of me being adventurous.
