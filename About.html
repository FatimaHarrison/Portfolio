         Hello, My name is Fatima and I am currently a college student moving up to my Junior year. I started my college year in Aug 2022 after graduating with honors in High School. After, moving from up North I built my interest in computers, coding, and manufacturing. During my high school years, I received two certificates one is for front-end web design and the other is for advanced manufacturing. I do have the knowledge and skills to also do back-end web design which I would prefer to use Javascript and C programs added along with it. What inspired me to have this interest is mainly because of how technology and other projects are created. As a teen, I used to analyze the video games I played from their graphics and their dialect.</p>
           
         <p> Knowing that there are many programs behind one video game motivated me to start advancing my skills in coding and learning other languages within coding. As for manufacturing, I love to assemble projects such as EBA or welding things together. I took a Mechatronics class and we laid out a blueprint of how to fix different machinery within a warehouse, which I found pretty interesting. From the certificates I received in Advanced Manufacturing, I have the knowledge and skills to operate CNC machinery, operate welding machinery, and weld, and saute electrical boards and cables. lot enjoying the outdoors and going on adventures. However, I would like to continue to accelerate those skills.</p>
           <br>
        <p> 
         A little bit more about myself is that I love to travel to different countries and states and explore their environment. On my downtime
         I love to enjoy the outdoors go on adventures, and many more fun things. Sometimes, I would watch videos on different projects  and also teach myself another language so I can be able to communicate more with others. Overall, I usually try new things most of the day. It's a part of me being adventurous.
